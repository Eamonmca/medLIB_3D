# medLIB_3D

- A user-focused, multi-functional, flexible and extensible medical imaging library focused on acquiring, preparing and recording data for use with machine learning.
- Designed to eliminate the complicated and time-consuming but necessary preprocessing steps at different levels of granularity (dataset-level, scan level, facility-level, patient-level, slice-level)
- Envisioned as a bridge between various data formats with functionality to account for each modality's specific requirements.
- An object-oriented programming approach to managing 3D volumes of medical data.
- Task-oriented and test drove on real-world problems, designed to encourage active experimentation and rapid prototyping in notebook environments.
